Fixed Bugs
==========

* :jirabug:`PXC-889`: Fixed an issue where a node with an invalid value for
  :variable:wsrep_provider was allowed to start up and operate in standalone
  mode, which could lead to data inconsistency. The node will now abort in
  this case. Bug fixed :bug:`1728774`

* :jirabug:`PXC-850`: ensured that a node, because of data inconsistency,
  isolates itself before leaving the cluster, thus allowing pending nodes
  to re-evaluate the quorum. Bug fixed :bug:`1704404`

* :jirabug:`PXC-875`: Fixed an issue where toggling :variable:wsrep_provider
  off and on failed to reset some internal variables and resulted in PXC
  logging an "Unsupported protocol downgrade" warning. Bug fixed
  :bug:`1379204`

* :jirabug:`PXC-883`: Fixed ``ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT`` incorrect operation
  on slaves by avoiding useless wsrep plugin register for a savepoint
  rollback. Bug fixed :bug:`1700593`

* :jirabug:`PXC-887`: gcache .page files were unnecessarily created due to
  an error in projecting gcache free size when configured to recover on
  restart.

* :jirabug:`PXC-895`: fixed transaction loss after recovery by
  avoiding interruption of the binlog recovery based on wsrep saved position.
  Bug fixed :bug:`1734113`

* :jirabug:`PXC-897`: fixed empty :variable:`gtid_executed` variable after
  recovering the position of a node with ``--wsrep_recover``.

* :jirabug:`PXC-906`: fixed certification failure in the case of a node
  restarting at the same time when frequent ``TRUNCATE TABLE`` commands and
  DML writes occur simultaneously on other nodes. Bug fixed :bug:`1737731`

* :jirabug:`PXC-914`: Suppressing DDL/TOI replication in case of
  :variable:`sql_log_bin` zero value didn't work when DDL statement was
  modifying an existing table, resulting in an error.
